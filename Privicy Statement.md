# Privacy Statement for Button Click Logger Chrome Extension

[The Button Click Logger Chrome extension captures](https://github.com/benjamayden/Click-through-flow-recorder), stores, and manages data locally on the user’s device. This privacy statement outlines how the extension handles collected data, especially click logs and images, to ensure data security and user privacy.

## 1\. Data Collection and Processing

The Button Click Logger captures the following data points when recording is active:

* **Element text** of clicked UI elements, allowing for contextual logging of user actions.

* **URL of the page** where each click occurs to provide context within the workflow.

* **Timestamp** of each click for sequence tracking purposes.

* **Screenshot of the visible area** of the browser tab at the time of each click (or cmd+shift+K). This image is attached to each log entry to visually document the recorded click.

## 2\. Data Storage

All collected data is stored **locally** in the browser’s storage:

* **Click logs and screenshots** are saved within Chrome’s local storage.

* The stored screenshots are intended for use only within the extension and are **not shared externally or uploaded** to any external servers.

## 3\. Data Retention and Deletion

The extension includes functionality to clear all locally stored data:

* **Clear Log Button**: The extension provides a “Clear Log” button, which removes all stored log entries and their associated screenshots. Upon confirmation, both the click logs and images are deleted from local storage, ensuring no residual data remains within the extension.

## 4\. Downloadable Content

In addition to storing data locally, the extension provides features to display and interact with the flow of logged data:

* **Image Download**: The flow display allows users to download individual screenshots (images) that were captured during the logging process. These images are stored **locally** on the user’s device when downloaded, and no image data is transmitted externally by the extension.  
* **Saving as PDF**: Users are prompted to save the flow (which may include images, logs, and other metadata) as a PDF file. The generated PDF file is stored **locally** on the user's device. No data is uploaded or shared with external servers during the save-to-PDF process.

## 4\. Data Security

To protect user privacy:

* **Access Permissions**: The extension requires permissions for active tab access, storage, and screen capture. These permissions are restricted to the extension’s functionality and are not used for any other purposes.

* **No External Data Transmission**: All data handling occurs on the local device, and the extension does not transmit any captured data to external servers or third parties.

## Summary

The Button Click Logger extension is designed with a focus on local data storage and user control over data retention. All captured data, including images, remains on the user’s device and is fully removable by clearing the logs. The extension does not transmit any data to external servers, and all access permissions align strictly with its functionality.
